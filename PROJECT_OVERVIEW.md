# BrainLeap MVP - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Description

BrainLeap MVP is an AI-powered educational mobile application that helps students (Class 8, 9, and 10) learn mathematics through interactive problem-solving. Students solve problems by drawing on a digital whiteboard, and AI verifies their handwritten solutions.

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Subject & Class Selection**: Choose from different subjects and grade levels
2. **AI-Generated Questions**: Math problems generated by Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
3. **Whiteboard Drawing**: Draw solutions naturally with touch/stylus
4. **AI Vision Verification**: Solutions analyzed and verified using AI
5. **Instant Feedback**: Get detailed feedback and explanations
6. **Modern UI**: Beautiful, intuitive interface with smooth animations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React Native (Expo)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6
- **Drawing Engine**: @shopify/react-native-skia
- **Gesture Handling**: react-native-gesture-handler
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API
- **Image Processing**: react-native-view-shot, expo-file-system

## 🎨 Design System

### Colors

- **Primary**: #6366f1 (Indigo)
- **Success**: #10b981 (Green)
- **Error**: #ef4444 (Red)
- **Warning**: #f59e0b (Amber)
- **Background**: #f5f5f5 (Light Gray)
- **Text**: #1f2937 (Dark Gray)

### Typography

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: 
   - Never commit `config.js` with real API key
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Consider backend proxy for API calls

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - No user data stored currently
   - All processing happens in real-time
   - Consider adding privacy policy

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement throttling for API calls
   - Add loading states to prevent spam

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

1. **Canvas Performance**:
   - Using Skia for hardware-accelerated rendering
   - Path optimization for smooth drawing
   - Gesture handling with native driver

2. **API Optimization**:
   - Image compression before sending
   - Efficient base64 encoding
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Bundle Size**:
   - Using Expo managed workflow
   - Tree shaking for unused code
   - Lazy loading where possible
